**Documentation of Externally Hosted GitHub Page**

Steps:

1. Previously, I had created the `sbatten1969.github.io` repository -- it's been two years so I don't remember the details, but there it is.
2. In my `sandbox1` repository, I created the `docs/` directory and the `test1.html` file in that directory.
3. In the repository's **Settings** tab [https://github.com/sbatten1969/sandbox1/settings], I found the _GitHub Pages_ section and enabled it for the master branch, docs folder only.
4. Once I turned it on, this page became live: [http://sbatten1969.github.io/sandbox1/test1.html]

**Markdown Syntax Examples**

* This is supposed to be an itemized item
* Second item

This is a `short codeSegment;` embedded in text.

```
this.isA() {
  blockOfCode();
  CanItGoOnForManyLines answer = YES;
  // But let's just stop here
}
```
